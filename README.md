# Distance-Measurements
I'm excited to share my implementation of a distance measurement system using the ATmega32 microcontroller and the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. Here's a glimpse of what we've accomplished:

- 📏 Utilizes the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for precise distance measurements.
- 🖥️ Interfaces with an LCD for displaying distance data.
- 📦 Designed with a structured architecture model:
 - HAL Layer: LCD and HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.
 - MCAL Layer: GPIO and Input Capture Unit (ICU).
